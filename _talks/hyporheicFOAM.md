* Develop an open-source solver, {https://github.com/hiter-joe/hyporheicFoam}{HyporheicFOAM}, based on the computational platform {(https://openfoam.org/)}{OpenFOAM}, to include full surface-subsurface coupling under dynamic conditions and extend it further to include biogeochemical reactive transport in porous media;
 * Analyze the large amount of data obtained from model simulations, explain the physical mechanisms behind the scenarios, and improve the empirical formulations for multi-scale predictions.
