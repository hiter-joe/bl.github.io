Coastal Observations, Mechanisms, and Predictions Across Systems and Scales.
* Coordinate and work with other analysts to integrate module models into larger system assemblies
** Build simulation capabilities for advanced modeling purposes using Python, C++ or other programming languages;
** Process 3D digital elevation model data to generate high-quality meshes appropriate for numerical simulation;
** Build computational pipelines for large-scale simulations in HPC environments;
** To develop predictive understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and consequences of the shift between biochemical conditions at sediment-water interfaces.
