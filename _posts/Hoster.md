To host a meeting, you will typically need to create an account with the platform you choose, then schedule and invite participants to the meeting. Once the meeting starts, the host can share their screen, make presentations, and interact with participants through video and audio.

As the host of an online meeting, there are a few things you should keep in mind to ensure the meeting runs smoothly:

Test your equipment and internet connection before the meeting to make sure everything is working properly.

Be on time for the meeting and make sure all participants are aware of the start time.

Clearly communicate the agenda and any materials participants should review before the meeting.

Make sure that all participants are introduced and that they can hear and see each other properly.

Monitor the chat function to make sure that all participants are able to communicate and ask questions during the meeting.

Use the mute and video on/off function to control noise and distractions during the meeting.

Use the screen-sharing feature to present slides, documents or share your screen to all participants.

Keep an eye on the time and make sure the meeting doesn't run over its allotted time.

Have a backup plan in case of technical difficulties or other issues.

Follow up with participants after the meeting to ensure that all action items have been completed and to address any questions that may have come up during the meeting.

Also, some non-technical things to take care as a hoster

Be mindful of the time difference for all participants
Be respectful of different cultural norms during the meeting
Stay Professional and be in the formal attire if necessary.
