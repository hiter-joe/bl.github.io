* Water level: is known as gauge height or stage, is the elevation of the free surface of a seam, stream, lake or reservoir relative to a specified vertical datum.
  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_level)
  ** In hydrology, stage refers to the water level in a river or stream with respect to a chosen reference height. 
  
* water head: or hydraulic head= pressure head + elevation, is a specific measureent of liquid pressure above a vertical datum. 
  It was usually measured as a liquid surface elevation, expressed in units of length. 
  There are four types of head used to calculate the total head in and out of a pump:

  ** Velocity head is due to the bulk motion of a fluid (kinetic energy). Its pressure head correspondent is the dynamic pressure.
  ** Elevation head is due to the fluid's weight, the gravitational force acting on a column of fluid.
  ** Pressure head is due to the static pressure, the internal molecular motion of a fluid that exerts a force on its container.
  ** Resistance head (or friction head or Head Loss) is due to the frictional forces acting against a fluid's motion by the container.

* water table: is the upper surface of zone of saturation/ is the surface where the water pressure head is equal to the atmospheric pressure.
