In this post, the units used in ATS can be found.
Neumann (mass flux) boundary condition:
The concentration 
surface-mass_flux Observation file: extensive integral  mol/s

The unit of mass flux should be mol /m/s for surface flow and mol/m2/s for subsurface flow.
Amanzi had always been in mass units, ATS use mol.

For mesh generation, ats has "verify mesh" option. ===>
Generated mesh are by definition strutured.
