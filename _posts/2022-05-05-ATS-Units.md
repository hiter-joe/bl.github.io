In this post, the units used in ATS can be found.
Neumann (mass flux) boundary condition:
The concentration 
surface-mass_flux Observation file: extensive integral  mol/s

The unit of mass flux should be mol /m/s for surface flow and mol/m2/s for subsurface flow.
Amanzi had always been in mass units, ATS use mol.

For mesh generation, ats has "verify mesh" option. ===>
Generated mesh are by definition strutured. 


Molar concentration: ci= xi* c = xi* rho /M_
ci is molar concentration, c is the total molar concentration, xi is the molar fraction, rho is the density of the solution, M_ is the average molar mass (18.0153).
mol/m3 = (mol/mol * kg/ m3 )/ (kg /mol)
