The fraction of energy going toward biomass synthesis can affect the reaction rate in a few ways. First, if a large fraction of the energy is being used for biomass synthesis, then there may be less energy available for other reactions to occur. This could lead to a slower overall reaction rate.

Second, the biomass itself can act as a product or reactant in certain reactions, and the rate of these reactions may be affected by the amount of biomass present. For example, if the reaction being studied produces biomass as a product, then a larger fraction of energy going toward biomass synthesis could result in a faster reaction rate. On the other hand, if the reaction being studied consumes biomass as a reactant, then a larger fraction of energy going toward biomass synthesis could result in a slower reaction rate.

Overall, the exact effect of the fraction of energy going toward biomass synthesis on the reaction rate will depend on the specific reaction being studied and the specific conditions under which it is occurring.
