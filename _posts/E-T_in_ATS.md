In advanced aquatic simulation, evaporation and transpiration are two important processes that are often modeled.

Evaporation is the process by which water is converted from a liquid to a gaseous state and is transported into the atmosphere. The Penman-Monteith equation is a commonly used method to estimate evaporation from open water surfaces such as lakes and rivers. It takes into account several meteorological factors such as net radiation, air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity and atmospheric pressure.

Transpiration is the process by which water is absorbed by plants and lost to the atmosphere through small openings on the leaves called stomata. The Penman-Monteith equation can also be used to estimate transpiration from vegetation, but other models such as the Jarvis and the Priestley-Taylor models are also used.

The specific equations used in an aquatic simulation will depend on the complexity and scope of the simulation and the types of aquatic systems being simulated.

A common equation for evaporation is:
E = (Rn - G) / (rho * lambda)

Where:
E = evaporation rate (mm/day)
Rn = net radiation (W/m^2)
G = soil heat flux (W/m^2)
rho = air density (kg/m^3)
lambda = latent heat of vaporization (J/kg)

And for transpiration:
T = (GPP - Rm - Rg) / (rho * lambda)

Where:
T = transpiration rate (mm/day)
GPP = gross primary production (gC/m2/day)
Rm = maintenance respiration (gC/m2/day)
Rg = growth respiration (gC/m2/day)
rho = air density (kg/m^3)
lambda = latent heat of vaporization (J/kg)

These are examples of the equations that can be used to model evaporation and transpiration in advanced aquatic simulation, but it's worth noting that the equations and models used in aquatic simulation may vary depending on the scope and purpose of the simulation.
