Recently I was introduced to a product called Doxygen, which allows for automatic software documentation generation from comments in the source code. The product page is at https://lnkd.in/gwD8CdAS, I used it to generate the documentation for AMANZI-ATS.


As a new learner of ATS. I have generated the html folder for AMANZI-ATS. It helps me a lot and wanna share with the group.
You can find it via this link. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZrWks-jgWZWZNPgT-IkPIjSGomo5lVoR?usp=sharing  You can download it (450M) and open the index.html. Then you can see the C++ Code Guide of ATS:
