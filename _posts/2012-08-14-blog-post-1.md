Recently I was introduced to a product called Doxygen, which allows for automatic software documentation generation from comments in the source code. The product page is at https://lnkd.in/gwD8CdAS, I used it to generate the documentation for AMANZI-ATS.

The C++ Code Guide of ATS can be found here.
