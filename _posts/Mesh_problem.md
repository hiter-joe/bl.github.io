There are several reasons why a smaller mesh (i.e., one with a higher density of grid points) might have convergence problems:

Discretization error: When a physical system is discretized (i.e., represented as a set of grid points), some error is introduced due to the approximation of continuous variables as discrete quantities. This error can be reduced by using a finer mesh, but it can also increase if the mesh is too fine and leads to numerical instability.

Numerical stability: Finer meshes can often lead to greater numerical stability, but in some cases, they can also cause instability. This can happen if the mesh is too fine and leads to a condition called "mesh dependency," where the solution is highly sensitive to the specific arrangement of the grid points.

Solution accuracy: In some cases, a finer mesh might not necessarily lead to a more accurate solution. For example, if the physical processes being simulated are not well-resolved by the mesh, using a finer mesh will not necessarily lead to improved accuracy.

Computational cost: Finer meshes require more computational resources to solve, and in some cases, the increased cost might not be justified by the improvement in accuracy.

To troubleshoot convergence problems with a smaller mesh, it is important to carefully consider all of these factors and determine the root cause of the issue.
