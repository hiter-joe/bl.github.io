Precipitation refers to any form of water, such as rain, snow, sleet, or hail, that falls to the ground from the atmosphere. The precipitation pattern refers to the distribution, frequency, and amount of precipitation in a given area over a period of time. This can vary depending on factors such as location, season, and weather systems. For example, some areas may experience a lot of precipitation during the winter months and very little during the summer, while others may have more consistent precipitation throughout the year.

Sea level refers to the average height of the surface of the ocean with respect to a reference level, such as mean sea level (MSL). Sea level can change over time due to a variety of factors, including changes in ocean currents, ocean temperature, and the amount of water in the ocean. The sea level pattern refers to the distribution and variation of sea level over a period of time.

Sea level rise is one of the most well-known sea level pattern and it is caused by global warming and the thermal expansion of seawater as it warms and by the melting of ice sheets and glaciers. Sea level rise can have significant impacts on coastal communities and infrastructure.

Another sea level pattern is the tide which is caused by the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun on the Earth's oceans. Tidal patterns repeat every lunar day (about 24 hours and 50 minutes) and are affected by the shape of the coastline, ocean currents and the weather.
