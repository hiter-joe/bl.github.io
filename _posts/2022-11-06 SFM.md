Structure from motion (SfM)[1] is a photogrammetric range imaging technique for estimating three-dimensional structures from two-dimensional image 
sequences that may be coupled with local motion signals. It is studied in the fields of computer vision and visual perception. In biological vision, 
SfM refers to the phenomenon by which humans (and other living creatures) can recover 3D structure from the projected 2D (retinal) motion field of 
a moving object or scene.

#### Structure-from-motion photogrammetry with multi-view stereo provides hyperscale landform models using images acquired from a range of digital cameras and optionally a network of ground control points. The technique has been applied in many settings such as rivers,[20] badlands,[21] sandy coastlines,[22][23] fault zones,[24] landslides,[25] and coral reef settings.[26] SfM has been also successfully applied for the assessment of large wood accumulation volume[27] and porosity[28] in fluvial systems, as well as for the characterization of rock masses through the determination of some properties as the orientation, persistence, etc. of discontinuities.[29][30] A full range of digital cameras can be utilized, including digital SLR's, compact digital cameras and even smart phones. Generally though, higher accuracy data will be achieved with more expensive cameras, which include lenses of higher optical quality. The technique therefore offers exciting opportunities to characterize surface topography in unprecedented detail and, with multi-temporal data, to detect elevation, position and volumetric changes that are symptomatic of earth surface processes. Structure from motion can be placed in the context of other digital surveying methods. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_from_motion)

To have a better re-built model, the more figures from different location the better results.
